Hello and welcome to the most expensive work of art. Why is this the most expensive work of art?
Is it because it is the most beautiful? Did it take the most effort to make? Did it cost the most to realize?
No. It is the most expensive work of art because I, the artist, say it is.
That’s right, the concept of being the most expensive work of art *is* the work of art.

This work is currently priced at **$450,300,001**.
This might seem steep—especially for an Internet artwork that is accessible worldwide—but this is a sound investment.
At some point, some other work of art is bound to be sold for more than that,
at which point this work of art automatically becomes more expensive (and could potentially be sold as such).
